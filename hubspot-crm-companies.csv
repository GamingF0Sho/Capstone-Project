In two years we set a production record for Sears in Little Rock and were asked to open another office in Memphis, Tennessee.

President Dwight D. Eisenhower established the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in 1958, partially in response to the Soviet Union's launch of the first artificial satellite the previous year. NASA grew out of the National Advisory Committee on Aeronautics (NACA), which had been researching flight technology for more than 40 years. President John F. Kennedy focused NASA and the nation on sending astronauts to the moon by the end of the 1960s. Through the Mercury and Gemini projects, NASA developed the technology and skills it needed for the journey. On July 20, 1969, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin became the first of 12 men to walk on the moon, meeting Kennedy's challenge. Meanwhile, NASA was continuing the aeronautics research pioneered by NACA. It also conducted purely scientific research and worked on developing applications for space technology, combining both pursuits in developing the first weather and communications satellites. After Apollo, NASA focused on creating a reusable ship to provide regular access to space: the space shuttle. First launched in 1981, the space shuttle flew more than 130 successful flights before retiring in 2011. In 2000, the United States and Russia established permanent human presence in space aboard the International Space Station, a multinational project representing the work of 16 nations. NASA also has continued its scientific research. In 1997, Mars Pathfinder became the first in a fleet of spacecraft that will explore Mars in the next decade, as we try to determine if life ever existed there. The Terra and Aqua satellites are flagships of a different fleet, this one in Earth orbit, designed to help us understand how our home world is changing. NASA's aeronautics teams are focused on improved aircraft travel that is safer and cleaner.

Targeting professionals, the product stands out from a sea of free services by offering business-grade features, high quality, reliability, and live customer support. Line2 has won countless awards, including first place in the Mobile Apps Showdown at CES 2011. It was named one of the top ten must have apps by David Pogue of the New York Times, and was named one of the top 100 most brilliant ideas of 2010 by Entrepreneur Magazine. Line2 is focused 100% on addressing the market created by the boom in smartphone sales, which surpassed PC sales for the first time earlier this year. Other major trends that Toktumi taps into include the shift away from wired Internet and phone services, the shift to virtual offices and mobile workforces and the rapid growth of cloud-based services. Line2 is a beachhead on the smartphone desktop through which additional services can be offered that are valuable to professionals. Business phone service is just the beginning. The companys strategy is based on its tight focus on this new mobile work environment, a frugal spending philosophy, and a focus on premium customers who value their product and are willing to pay for it. The company will be profitable later this year.",http://linkedin.com/company/line2,,,HelloLine2,,0,0,API,,Offline Sources,1/13/2016 16:06,,,,,,,,

ESUs are service-oriented, non-regulatory agencies designed to achieve a better balance of educational opportunities for students regardless of the population, financial differences, or geographic limitations of school districts. The governing unit consists of an elected board of 9 members. Members are elected for four-year terms from nine distinct election districts. Meetings are conducted at 7:00 p.m. on the third Monday of each month. Educational Service Unit 10 utilizes an advisory committee structure for the purpose of receiving feedback and developing recommendations for services that are provided to schools. Local school administrators and county superintendents are elected by their peers to serve on the Administrator Advisory Committee, which meets at least four times during the year. The recommendations of the committee are considered by the school districts in the ESU 10 area. Once two-thirds of the school districts that contain at least one-half of the student population approve the administrator advisory committee recommendations, the Board of Directors makes the final decisions concerning the program of services for the unit. Educational Service Unit 10 employs 93 staff members who provide services to students in the counties of Blaine, Buffalo, Custer, Dawson, Garfield, Greeley, Hall, Howard, Loup, Sherman, and Valley.
