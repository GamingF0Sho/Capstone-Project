# Predicting Future Revenue: StandDesk B2B Customers

## Introduction: The Problem

Leaving money on the table is a problem most companies try to avoid. It’s an issue that
presents itself to business in many forms. As a business gains more customers it can become
increasingly difficult to determine which of them are likely to order more products, and why.
Our focus will be on maximizing revenue from current customers who are likely to make
additional purchases. 

## Data Set

The StandDesk dataset consists of 3 csv files:
- Order Report: Sales by customer 6.24wID1.csv (Shopify)
- Company Report: hubspot-crm-view-companies2016-06-24wIDclean1.csv (Hubspot)
- Contact Report: hubspot-crm-view-contacts2016-06-24wID2.csv (Hubspot)

## Conclusion

Unfortunately, the final result of this project is that we currently have insufficient accurate data to use
to predict future revenue of StandDesk’s B2B customers. These results underscore the importance of
tracking and maintaining accurate data in the 21st century economy. We have a myriad of ways of
collecting and storing data related to potential and current customers and that data is extremely
valuable if utilized properly. On the other hand, if it is not collected or stored properly, it has no value to
us.
